# CSS Media Queries

## Targeting different screen widths

The point at which the layout switches from one design to another is called a breakpoint.

```css
/* Mobile */
body {
  font-size: 16px;
}

/* Tablet */
@media (min-width: 800px) {
  body {
    font-size: 18px;
  }
}

/* Wide screen */
@media (min-width: 12000px) {
  body {
    font-size: 20px;
  }
}
```

Building mobile-first means mobile styles are not in a media query.

## Handling user preferences

When possible, design to fit the userâ€™s system preferences.

Some users prefer darker colors on their screen due to light fatigue or other reasons.

Accomodate those users whenever possible by providing an alternate design.

```css
body {
  background-color: lightyellow;
}

@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) {
  body {
    background-color: darkpurple;
  }
}
```

Some system preferences define accessibility settings.

Animations should always be gated so as not to disturb those with motion disorders.

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference) {
  .spinner {
    animation: spin-around-the-page 2s;
  }
}
```
